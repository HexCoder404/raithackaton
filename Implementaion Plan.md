    this.timestamp = timestamp;
    this.data = data;           // Transaction data
    this.previousHash = previousHash;
    this.hash = this.calculateHash();
  }
}

class Blockchain {
  constructor() {
    this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
    this.batchIndex = {};       // Fast batch lookup
  }
}
```

### Smart Contract Framework
```javascript
const smartContracts = {
  paymentContract: {
    execute: (functionName, params) => { /* implementation */ },
    validate: (params) => { /* validation logic */ },
    logEvent: (event, data) => { /* logging */ }
  },
